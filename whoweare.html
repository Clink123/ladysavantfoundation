                <h3>Erin Lepone</h3>
                <p class="flow-text">Erin is a co-founder of the Lady Savant Foundation. Before getting into the philanthropic world, she had a career in finance where she worked for an alternative asset firm investing in hedge funds for close to 8 years. As fate would have it, she met her husband working in the same field and now is a stay at home mom in NJ with him and their 2 beautiful and rambunctious young boys, as well as very gifted and talented step son teenager.
                    <br>
                    <br> After leaving work to raise the boys, she ventured out in the non-profit world and LOVED it! She was lucky enough to start working with The Robin Hood Foundation, a NYC based organization. Erin assisted in various projects over the past 2 years there including outreach programs such as the Lemonaid Project, the annual Investor Conference, various Holiday programs.
                    <br>
                    <br> Erin became close friends with her neighbor Brandyn (as they are raising all young boys!) and Brandyn mentioned that she would love to get her organization, Lady Savant, to get out in the community and get more involved in philanthropic ventures. From there the Lady Savant Foundation took root. Erin organized more grass roots opportunities for the members such as volunteering in local soup kitchens and a Habitat For Humanity build day, before becoming more official as a registered 501c3.
                    <br>
                    <br> Erin's passions are tennis and traveling. She graduated in 2000 from the University of Southern California with a BA in International Relations and an emphasis on Business Administration. She then went abroad after working at a dot.com, landing a dual Masters program in Europe. She graduated in 2002 with an MA from the University of Exeter (England) in European Studies, and an MA from the Universidad de Salamanca (Spain) in Latin American Studies (Maestria de Estudios Latinoamericanos). Her dissertation was focused on Political Risk Analysis.
